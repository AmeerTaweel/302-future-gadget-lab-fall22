# ESCAPE FROM KOÇ

### Brief Introduction

Escape from KOÇ is an easy-to-play game that combines fun and challenge. 
The game space takes place on the KOÇ university campus where a student is trying to find a sequence of keys in the campus buildings. 
The game starts when the player enters one of the buildings and starts looking for a key in different rooms. 
During that journey, aliens may show up and try to catch the player, who should try to escape or distract them. 
The player is aiming at finding the key before the timeout. To accomplish that, some hints show up here and there. 
Once the key is found, the building will be marked as complete and the player can choose the next open building, which is basically the next level. 
Some promotions can be offered, like adding more time. 
The game is over If the player fails to find the key within the time limit. If he manages to find all the keys, then he wins the game.

### Gameplay:

The player walks around using **the arrow keys.** He/she can go to the east, west, north and south but cannot pass through walls. 
He/she can only open the exit door of a building if he/she finds the key. 
The game starts from the Student Center. Finding the keys one by one, the player's aim is to travel to these buildings 
in the given order: CASE building, SOS building, SCI building, ENG building and SNA building. 
Once the player finds the exit key from the SNA building, the game ends and the player wins. 
To find the keys, the player uses a **left click** on the objects with the mouse and if the key is there, 
it appears for a second and then, the door is opened. However, to click the objects, the player should be next to the objects. 
Player has a bag to collect the power ups and keep them for later use. 
While collecting power-ups and trying to find keys, the player also needs to escape from the aliens.
